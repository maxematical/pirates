AI Behaviors:
- Pursue: when the AI is too far, move closer to the player
- Circle and fire: when the AI is close enough (but not too close) and they have a good angle to fire.
  Continue to circle as long as the player is in range

Most efficient way to turn:
179 -> -179
Way 1: 179-(-179) = 358 (Turn decreasing the angle)
Way 2: 360-358   = 2    (Turn increasing the angle)
Way 2 is closer


Comparing angle distance
150 vs 359 who wins? 359 Bigger isn't always better
150 vs -1 who wins? -1 Closer to zero is better
